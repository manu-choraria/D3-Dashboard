# D3-Dashboard
This Repository consists of the D3.js  dashboard code on Crime analysis 
Crime is one of the major points of concern for a state government, local authority, and central government. The Number of crimes varies from state to state and Union Territory to Union Territory. Moreover, the number of different types of crimes also varies from place to place. The Crime rate analysis can help the government about the major points of concern and which state they have to focus on more. It can also help the state government to find their relative positions from other states and take inspiration from them. The Crime Rate analysis deals with the year-wise representation of the total cases as well as rapes, murders, and assaults in different states and Union Territories. The major points of concern can be easily identified and will be useful for central government, survey agencies, and major home departments of states.

We have included various standard and comparative graphs in our dashboard like bar chart, donut chart, stacked chart, multi-bar chart. We have also used various modern and stylish charts like lollipop chart and circular bar-plot. We have also used various interactive components like hovering, legends, and css chart swapping.
